> Make sure **OpenGL** and **GLUT** are installed and environment is configured.

#### ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions:

1. **Download and Install GLUT**:
   - Download GLUT from:  
     [http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/](http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/)
   - Extract the files and:
     - Copy `.h` files to:  
       `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\...\include\GL\`
     - Copy `.lib` or `.a` files to:  
       `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\...\lib\`
     - Copy `.dll` to:  
       `C:\Windows\System32`

2. **Add MinGW to PATH**:
   - Open Environment Variables â†’ System Variables â†’ `Path`
   - Add:  
     `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\...\bin`

3. **Compile and Run**:
